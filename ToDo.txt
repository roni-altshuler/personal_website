Experience   
Research Associate II | Chan Zuckerberg Biohub SF                                                      
● Designed and implemented a custom Cellpose-based zebrafish cell segmentation model.  
2024 – 2025 
○  Developed methods to generate training/testing field-of-view datasets from whole-embryo MERFISH 
images, including a novel strategy to select training data using Shannon’s entropy.  
○  Increased model F1 score from 53% to 85%, significantly enhancing segmentation accuracy to support 
upstream data analysis processes.  
● Contributed to the Tabula Sapiens Rosetta Donor project, integrating isoform-level information with traditional 
single-cell gene expression analyses to add a new dimension to the consortium’s data resources.  
● Performed high-throughput sequencing for internal and external investigators, including QC workflows 
(TapeStation, qPCR), sequencing (MiSeq i100, NextSeq 2000, and NovaSeq X), and post-run analysis 
(demultiplexing reports, AWS-based data tokenization and delivery).  
Master’s Research | University of California, Santa Cruz Genomics Institute               
2023 – 2024  
● Developed a custom Cellpose2.0 model for spatial transcriptomic data analysis, achieving precision and recall 
metrics of 84% and 90%.  
● Identified critical gene expression patterns through spatial differential analysis, revealing tumor 
microenvironment insights.  
● Visualized spatial distributions and performed clustering analyses using Python tools like UMAP.  
CRISPR-X Intern | CRISPR Therapeutics                                                                                     
● Led a project on 3’-overhang dsDNA integration, boosting CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in efficiency (validated via 
NGS). 
2023   
● Optimized T cell editing by integrating promoterless GFP transgenes and analyzing results with flow cytometry.  
Autoimmune Intern | CRISPR Therapeutics                                                         
● Enhanced CAR-T cell performance by analyzing costimulatory domain variations and improving targeting 
efficiency. 
● Evaluated cancer cell targeting outcomes using advanced flow cytometry and ddPCR techniques.

Projects page:
    soccer predictor blurb I want: Soccer Stats Predictor is a Next.js web app that lets users generate clear, data-driven soccer match predictions between teams or across leagues. Powered by machine learning on historical data, it shows intuitive win/draw/loss probabilities in an interactive, professional interface.

Education page:
    formatting should be similar to LinkedIn education page for user profile

Experience page:
    font color should be darker like the rest of the website, to have contrast with the off-white/cream color of the project card
    the entire title, for example Research Associate II | Chan Zuckerberg Biohub SF should glow when user hovers over
    also scale the logo of Chan Zuckerberg Biohub SF slightly larger so the user can actually make out the image
