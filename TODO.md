# To Do Items:

- Add a "Project" section to showcase personal projects with hyperlink to GitHub repo
- Add a custom Favicon for branding; I'm thinking the lion emoji 🦁
- Maybe it is worth updating/editing the blurb about me on the homepage to not be as long-winded and to be more concise but still informative about what I do know and what I'm interested in. I think it is a bit too long right now, and I want to make sure visitors get the main key points about me without having to read a long paragraph, the same goes for my interests outside of work (the second paragraph also on the homepage).
